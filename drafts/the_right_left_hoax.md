We are lead to believe that the "Right" and the "Extreme Right" are in opposites to the "Left" and "Communism" (Extreme Left). I beleive nothing could be further from the truth.

If this were so than there would be a difference between Communism and Fascism, which I fail to observe. Both are totalitarian regimes.

I could expound on this, but look for yourself. And don't let yourself be blinded by the "ideals" of either. Just observe what is or what has been.

The terms come from the French parliament after the French Revolution. A great explanation is here: https://theconversation.com/the-evolution-of-frances-left-and-right-politics-from-the-1789-french-revolution-to-this-years-election-76226

It appears that we have to choose side between the right or the left in one way or the other. They are not opposed.
